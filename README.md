# Abderraouf Bouarrata

Hi, my name is Raouf, and I am a skilled software engineer with a Master's Degree in computer science, and a deep passion for coding and technology, My first real project was my first school project, working with front-end. This experience sparked my interest in web development and inspired me to continually learn and improve my skills.

I began my professional journey with a 1-month internship at [Artec](https://artec-int.com/) where I had the opportunity to work with React for data visualization and to gain hands-on experience with responsive designs. After a productive month, I returned to college to complete my final semesters, eager to expand my skillset: Node.js and Next.js, always seeking to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly changing technology landscape.

I am excited about what the future holds and am committed to continuously learning and improving my skills.
